CLIMBER-X simulates the response of the Earth system to changes in different climate forcings, such as changes in greenhouse gas concentrations or in the Earth's orbital configuration. To do so the model represents the physical processes in atmosphere, ocean and on land that determine the climate state of the Earth. It also simulates the bio- and geochemical processes in the biosphere, soil, ocean and marine sediments and therefore allows for an interactive determination of the atmospheric CO2 and methane concentrations. CLIMBER-X also includes two different models for the continental ice sheets and a model for the response of the solid Earth to changes in surface load. Specifically, the model includes the following components: SESAM: semi-empirical statistical-dynamical atmosphere model GOLDSTEIN: 3-D frictional-geostrophic ocean model HAMOCC: ocean and sediments carbon cycle model SISIM: sea ice model PALADYN: land model Yelmo or SICOPOLIS: ice sheet models VILMA: viscoelastic lithosphere and mantle model The general CLIMBER-X design and the details of the climate model component are described in the following article: Willeit, M., Ganopolski, A., Robinson, A., and Edwards, N. R.: The Earth system model CLIMBER-X v1.0 \u2013 Part 1: Climate model description and validation, Geosci. Model Dev., 15, 5905\u20135948, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-15-5905-2022 , 2022. The global carbon cycle model of CLIMBER-X is described in: Willeit, M., Ilyina, T., Liu, B., Heinze, C., Perrette, M., Heinemann, M., Dalmonech, D., Brovkin, V., Munhoven, G., B\u00f6rker, J., Hartmann, J., Romero-Mujalli, G., and Ganopolski, A.: The Earth system model CLIMBER-X v1.0 \u2013 Part 2: The global carbon cycle, Geosci.

Follow the steps below to (1) obtain the code, (2) configure the Makefile(s) for your system, (3) compile an executable program 1. Get the code Clone the repository from https://github.com/cxesmc/climber-x : # Clone code repository git clone https://github.com/cxesmc/climber-x.git git clone git@github.com:cxesmc/climber-x.git # via ssh cd climber-x # Clone input file directory git clone https://gitlab.pik-potsdam.de/cxesmc/climber-x-input.git input git clone git@gitlab.pik-potsdam.de:cxesmc/climber-x-input.git input # via ssh If you plan to make changes to the code, it is wise to check out a new branch: git checkout -b user-dev You should now be working on the branch user-dev . If you would also like to run CLIMBER-X with an interactive carbon cycle, then the HAMOCC ocean biogeochemistry ( bgc ) code must also be downloaded: # bgc cd src/ git clone git@github.com:cxesmc/bgc.git cd bgc/ git submodule update --init --recursive # for submodule M4AGO cd ../.. Since the HAMOCC model code is not open source, the bgc repository is private at the moment and you need to be given permission in order to access it. HAMOCC is covered by the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology software licence agreement as part of the MPI-ESM ( https://code.mpimet.mpg.de/attachments/download/26986/MPI-ESM_SLA_v3.4.pdf ). A pre-requisite to access the bgc repository is therefore that you agree to the MPI-ESM license by following the steps outlined here: https://code.mpimet.mpg.de/projects/mpi-esm-license . Once you have done so, send an email to Matteo Willeit and you will be granted permission to access the bgc repository. If you would also like to run with an interactive ice sheet, the Yelmo ice-sheet code must be downloaded and configured and the solid Earth model VILMA libraries must be downloaded before compiling: # yelmo cd src git clone git@github.com:palma-ice/yelmo.git cd yelmo git checkout climber-x # Get climber-x branch cd ../.. # Return to climber-x parent directory # vilma cd src/ git clone git@github.com:cxesmc/vilma.git # private repository, premission needed cd .. 2. Create the system-specific Makefile To compile CLIMBER-X , you need to generate a Makefile that is appropriate for your system. In the folder config , you need to specify a configuration file that defines the compiler and flags, including definition of the paths to the NetCDF , FFTW , coordinates , Yelmo and LIS libraries. Note that it can be convenient to install FFTW , coordinates , Yelmo and LIS as subdirectories of the src/ folder, to be sure they are compiled consistently with CLIMBER-X . You can use another configuration file in the config folder as a template, e.g., cd config cp pik_ifort myhost_mycompiler Then you would modify the file myhost_mycompiler to match your paths. Back in climber-x , you can then generate your Makefile with the provided python configuration script: cd ../climber-x python config.py config/myhost_mycompiler The result should be a Makefile that is ready for use. If you want to use the ice sheet model you have to similarly create the Makefile for Yelmo: cd src/yelmo/ python config.py config/myhost_mycompiler cd ../.. 3. Compiling CLIMBER-X Assuming the source has been downloaded and configured, and all dependencies have also been compiled, now you are ready to compile CLIMBER-X . There are currently four different flavors of CLIMBER-X that can be compiled: climber-clim : minimal climate configuration with atmosphere, ocean, sea ice and land climber-clim-bgc : clim plus with ocean biogeochemistry climber-clim-ice : clim plus with ice sheets climber-clim-bgc-ice : clim plus with ocean biogeochemistry and ice sheets These can be compiled by calling the individual names, e.g. make climber-clim or make climber-clim-bgc-ice . By default, it is also possible to call make climber as a shorter alias for make climber-clim-bgc-ice , e.g.: make clean make climber The climate only version climber-clim corresponds to the version described by Willeit et al. (2022). This particular model setup does not require non-climate source code or the LIS library for compilation. That's it. The executable climber.x should now be available in the main directory. To compile the model with debug flags enabled use: make climber debug=1 By default, the model is compiled with openmp .

Copy namelist parameter files to RUNDIR . Make links to the input , maps and restart directories in RUNDIR . Copy VILMA restart files to RUNDIR (since these are eventually modified by climber.x ). Copy the executable file climber.x to RUNDIR . To run on the cluster, create a job submission script (e.g. job.submit ) in RUNDIR to manage various computing options (number of processors, etc). When these steps are completed, climber.x should be run directly from RUNDIR using the job submission script. E.g., using SLURM: cd RUNDIR sbatch job.submit If not using the cluster, CLIMBER-X can also be run manually by entering the RUNDIR and running the following: cd RUNDIR ./climber.x > out.out Either of the above will run climber in RUNDIR with all simulation output stored in the same directory. Because the directory includes the executable and is self-contained, assuming the contents of the linked directories do not change, the simulation can be re-run at any time. To perform all of the above steps manually for multiple simulations is very tedious and time-consuming, so a \"run\" script called runme is used to handle the process. Using runme Before using runme , the user should store a configuration file with some personal choices. To get started, copy the template config file to the main directory: cp .runme/runme_config .runme_config Next edit .runme_config so that the choices match your configuration. Mostly, this means setting hpc to the name of your current system and account to the default account to be used for your jobs submitted via SLURM. Also you can add your email address if you would like to receive notifications from SLURM about your jobs. Now runme is ready for use. See ./runme -h for details on possible arguments. Note that aside from possible optional arguments, runme is always called with the required argument -o RUNDIR that specifies the output directory. So, to run a climber.x simulation as a job on the cluster in RUNDIR , run the command: ./runme -rs -o RUNDIR where RUNDIR is the desired run directory. The option -r says that the job should actually be run (instead of just prepared) and -s specifies that the job should be run on the cluster. If -r is used alone, then the job is simply run as a background process. Other options include -q, --queue for the queue alias (short, priority, etc.), -w, --wall for the maximum wall clock time to allow in format HH:MM:SS, --part to name the processor partition (priority, standard, smp, etc), --omp to specify the number of processors, and others. See ./runme -h for all options. When called as above, this script will run a simulation using the parameters as they are specified in the namelist parameter files in the nml directory. In addition, it is possible to modify the parameters of one simulation at the command line using the argument -p KEY=VAL KEY=VAL ... . So, for example, the following command: ./runme -s -o RUNDIR -p ctl.n_accel=10 will run climber.x on the cluster in the output directory RUNDIR with the control parameter control.n_accel set to 10 . Note that ctl is a convenient alias for the namelist group control , as defined in .runme/climberx_info.json . To perform a simulation an ensemble of simulations with modified parameter values, runme should be called via jobrun (see below). Using jobrun with runme jobrun is a command that is part of the Python runner library, found here: https://github.com/cxesmc/runner . This command facilitates running ensembles of simulations, or simulations with modified parameters via a convenient command-line interface. See Dependencies for its installation instructions. Using jobrun , the following command would produce the same simulation as ./runme -s RUNDIR : jobrun ./runme -rs -o OUTDIR The difference here is that now we don't specify the specific RUNDIR , but rather an encapsulating OUTDIR that will contain one or more RUNDIR 's. In the above example, no parameters are changed, so the simulation is saved in the default directory: OUTDIR/default . If we want to change a parameter, this can be done as with the runme script via the -p option: jobrun ./runme -rs -o OUTDIR -p ctl.n_accel=10 This will produce one simulation with the parameter control.n_accel=10 . Since we have changed a parameter for this simulation, jobrun treats this as an ensemble, so the output is saved in OUTDIR/0 for simulation 0. In short, the above command is equivalent to ./runme -s -o OUTDIR -p ctl.n_accel=10 , but in the former case, the output is stored in OUTDIR/0 and in the latter case, it is stored directly in OUTDIR . The power of jobrun comes when we want to run an ensemble: jobrun ./runme -rs -o OUTDIR -p ctl.n_accel=1,5,10 This ensemble of simulations will appear in OUTDIR/0 , OUTDIR/1 and OUTDIR/2 , respectively. A more informative output directory can be made using the option -a along with -o : jobrun ./runme -rs -a -o OUTDIR -p ctl.n_accel=1,5,10 In this case, the run directories are OUTDIR/ctl.nccl.1 , OUTDIR/ctl.nccl.5 and OUTDIR/ctl.nccl.10 , respectively. General information about the ensemble can be found in the main ensemble directory OUTDIR : params.txt : contains a table of the parameter combinations set on the command line (can be used to run a new ensemble). info.txt : the same parameter table as params.txt , but also including an index of the runid (0,1,2, etc) and the RUNDIR : info.txt : runid ctl.n_accel rundir 0 1 ctl.nccl.1 1 5 ctl.nccl.5 2 10 ctl.nccl.10 It is of course possible to define multiple parameter permutations: jobrun ./runme -rs -o OUTDIR -p ctl.n_accel=1,5,10 smb.alb_ice=0.3,0.4 To generate a more complex ensemble, using e.g. Latin-Hypercube sampling, then a two step approach is often better. First, use the runner command job sample to build the ensemble, then use jobrun to run it: # Generate ensemble parameters job sample -o lhs.txt --seed 4 -N 100 atm.c_trop_2=0.8,1.2 smb.alb_ice=0.3,0.4 # Run ensemble jobrun ./runme -rs -o OUTDIR -i lhs.txt This two-step method facilitates checking that the ensemble was generated properly and improves reproducibility, since the exact parameter values are available in the table.","title":"Usage"},{"location":"usage/#running-climber-x","text":"After CLIMBER-X has been compiled, several steps must be completed to run the executable climber.x : Create a run directory ( RUNDIR ). Copy namelist parameter files to RUNDIR . Make links to the input , maps and restart directories in RUNDIR . Copy VILMA restart files to RUNDIR (since these are eventually modified by climber.x ). Copy the executable file climber.x to RUNDIR . To run on the cluster, create a job submission script (e.g. job.submit ) in RUNDIR to manage various computing options (number of processors, etc). When these steps are completed, climber.x should be run directly from RUNDIR using the job submission script. E.g., using SLURM: cd RUNDIR sbatch job.submit If not using the cluster, CLIMBER-X can also be run manually by entering the RUNDIR and running the following: cd RUNDIR ./climber.x > out.out Either of the above will run climber in RUNDIR with all simulation output stored in the same directory. Because the directory includes the executable and is self-contained, assuming the contents of the linked directories do not change, the simulation can be re-run at any time. To perform all of the above steps manually for multiple simulations is very tedious and time-consuming, so a \"run\" script called runme is used to handle the process.","title":"Running CLIMBER-X"},{"location":"usage/#using-runme","text":"Before using runme , the user should store a configuration file with some personal choices. To get started, copy the template config file to the main directory: cp .runme/runme_config .runme_config Next edit .runme_config so that the choices match your configuration. Mostly, this means setting hpc to the name of your current system and account to the default account to be used for your jobs submitted via SLURM. Also you can add your email address if you would like to receive notifications from SLURM about your jobs. Now runme is ready for use. See ./runme -h for details on possible arguments. Note that aside from possible optional arguments, runme is always called with the required argument -o RUNDIR that specifies the output directory. So, to run a climber.x simulation as a job on the cluster in RUNDIR , run the command: ./runme -rs -o RUNDIR where RUNDIR is the desired run directory. The option -r says that the job should actually be run (instead of just prepared) and -s specifies that the job should be run on the cluster. If -r is used alone, then the job is simply run as a background process. Other options include -q, --queue for the queue alias (short, priority, etc.), -w, --wall for the maximum wall clock time to allow in format HH:MM:SS, --part to name the processor partition (priority, standard, smp, etc), --omp to specify the number of processors, and others. See ./runme -h for all options. When called as above, this script will run a simulation using the parameters as they are specified in the namelist parameter files in the nml directory. In addition, it is possible to modify the parameters of one simulation at the command line using the argument -p KEY=VAL KEY=VAL ... . So, for example, the following command: ./runme -s -o RUNDIR -p ctl.n_accel=10 will run climber.x on the cluster in the output directory RUNDIR with the control parameter control.n_accel set to 10 . Note that ctl is a convenient alias for the namelist group control , as defined in .runme/climberx_info.json . To perform a simulation an ensemble of simulations with modified parameter values, runme should be called via jobrun (see below).","title":"Using runme"},{"location":"usage/#using-jobrun-with-runme","text":"jobrun is a command that is part of the Python runner library, found here: https://github.com/cxesmc/runner .
