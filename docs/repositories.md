# CLIMBER-X repository overview

Repositories are organized into several communities.

- `cxesmc` on GitHub: the main CLIMBER-X ESM community - for CLIMBER-X specific development.
- `cxesmc` on PIK-Gitlab: necessary for housing large input files (otherwise GitHub home would be enough).
- `fesmc` on GitHub: the Fast ESM community - for shared resources.
- `palma-ice` on GitHub: the PalMA ice-sheet modeling group at the Complutense University of Madrid, where the ice-sheet model Yelmo is developed.
